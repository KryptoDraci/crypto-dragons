# [CDRAG]Crypto-Dragons pool
We are few enthusiasts from Slovakia who run the Cardano stake pool to enrich the Cardano ecosystem.  

Please check our short [WIKI](https://github.com/KryptoDraci/crypto-dragons/wiki) in Slovak and English language to find out more about Cardano and how to stake with us.

The [[CDRAG] CryptoDragons pool](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool1wehqlvg34f3cpn48fa93qhnfkmxf5v3lxk9ymzukrm3tgxq34z2) was created as a side project by enthusiasts at the time of the "Crypto Crisis 2022", when they decided to support the Cardano project by creating and maintaining two active nodes, which are currently running in the cloud in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany on two separate Linux servers. Later we would like to expand the pool with another node, this time hosted directly in Slovakia.

We regularly maintain, upgrade and operate the nodes 24/7 regardless of whether they will produce blocks in a given epoch or will only be passively synchronized with the blockchain.

As ordinary citizens who don't have 100k EUR to invest right away, we are starting small and gradually, with the help of our friends and smaller investments, we are working towards building a competitive pool. So we are happy for any delegate.
